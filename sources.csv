Objectives/ data type/ Methodology","Carbon dioxide emissions from the use of coal, oil and gas (combustion and industrial processes), the process of gas flaring and the manufacture of cement. <br><br>METHODS<br>Detailed methods are provided in a working paper by Andrew and Peters (2022). Available at: https://zenodo.org/record/7215364#.Y-UJqnbMI2w<br><br>UNCERTAINTY<br>Global data have an uncertainly of ± 5% reported as ±1 sigma (68% chance that the real value lies within the given interval). Country data have variable uncertainty, generally of a few percent in industrialised countries and about ± 10% in China.<br><br>COUNTRIES WHOSE EMISSIONS HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED IN EARLY YEARS<br><br>Data for some countries have been generated using “disaggregation” of CDIAC’s data because of changes in nation states over time. For example, emissions data for Russia are not available prior to 1990. To generate a more complete and useful time series we have estimated emissions for Russia prior to 1990 first by using data from BP back to 1985, then by assuming that the share of Russia’s emissions in the USSR was constant up until 1985. Countries whose data are affected by this estimation method are listed on ""Methods"" section of http://www.globalcarbonatlas.org/en/CO2-emissions , and their data in earlier periods must be considered to have significantly higher uncertainty."
historical_emissions_gcp,Cautions: Known use limitations/cautions regarding: geographic/content coverage; source (inconsistency); methodology ,Climate Watch displays only territorial CO2 emissions. Global Carbon Project publishes additional data with regards to global carbon budget. Those data are not included on Climate Watch and can be found on: http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget. Data reported in million tonnes of carbon per year (MtC/yr) are converted to million tonnes of CO2 per year for purpose of Climate Watch by multiplying the values by 3.664. Data for years 2020 and 2021 are preliminary.
